            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <h4>What does this do?</h4>
            <p>This calculator compares two EV spreads and tells you what items to use in order to change the current spread into the new one. This is primarily used when you only have one copy of a Pokemon but need to change the EV spread to suit a different purpose. Changing spreads this way is also cheaper (in terms of in game items and currency) than wiping with a fresh start mochi and EVing from scratch.</p>

            <h4>Can't I just do this in my head?</h4>
            <p>Of course! And I did it that way for years myself. I just decided to write this for fun and to avoid doing extra math from time to time.</p>

            <h4>How do I enter my spreads?</h4>
            <p>The easiest way to do this is to click the "Import/Export" button on an individual Pokemon in the Showdown team builder and copy and paste the entire thing into each text box. The tool only searches for a string that begins with "EVs: " so you can also just paste the EVs and leave everything else off. This is done entirely in your browser, nothing is saved anywhere.</p>
            <p>If you don't use Pokemon Showdown for whatever reason, the format looks like this:</p>
            <p class="code">EVs: 188 HP / 68 Def / 100 SpA / 4 SpD / 148 Spe</p>
            <p>Only one stat is required for it to compute the difference, so the simplest accepted input would be something like this:</p>
            <p class="code">EVs: 0 HP</p>
            <p>EV names are: HP, Atk, Def, SpA, SpD, Spe</p>

            <h4>What are wasted EVs?</h4>
            <p>Sometimes you will see a warning below one of your spreads mentioning wasted EVs. At level 50 (which everything is auto-leveled to in VGC), the first 4 EVs will increase a stat by 1 point, and after that it takes 8 EVs to increase it further. As such your EVs should follow the formula:</p>
            <p class="code">(EVs - 4) % 8 == 0</p>
            <p>Essentially the EVs for each stat should be evenly divisible by 8 once you have subtracted the first 4. You can also have a maximum of 508 EVs total, with 252 being the max possible for one stat. The game will let you have 510 total, but the last 2 have no effect on level 50 Pokemon and can be ignored for our purposes.</p>
